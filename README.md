Cassandra Ybarola
**9 Arrowsmith**

You're my painkiller
When my brain gets bitter
You keep me close
You keep me close
I got front row seats for the park side livin'
Feel like the one but I'm one in a billion
Teenage cynical and I don't really know
What's the point of living if my heart gets broken?
Driving on the road, waiting for head-on collision
Springtime funeral, I miss you but I'd rather be alone
To keep me from
Heartbreaks, headaches
The doctor says I'm diagnosed with
Shit days, mistakes
But I'll be fine
But I'll be fine
'Cause you're my painkiller
When my brain gets bitter
You keep me close
When I've been miserable
And it takes forever
To let my brain get better
You keep me close
You keep me close
