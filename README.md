I would like to share you one of my favorite ongoing anime since One Piece is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Eiichiro Oda. It has been serialized in Shueisha's shōnen manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump since July 1997, with its individual chapters compiled into 104 tankōbon volumes as of November 2022. I've been watching this since last year. It may be have many episodes but it is worth to watch and I highly recommend you to watch it.

So Here are the k-pop Idols that I like for the past 3 years of liking them
